The idea is inspired by the movie The Golden Compass when in the world each person has their mascot to express their personality. Therefore, Limitless Creature World is born. Limitless Creature World is where you feel free to be creative. A creative world is based on the Polkapet game.  Polkapet (Polkadot + Pet) is an NFT game that is built on the Substrate of Polkadot. Each NFT is an animal that is designed based on your personality. Almost all users of web2 play the game and based on the Polkapet game, we open the doors of web3 to everyone.
